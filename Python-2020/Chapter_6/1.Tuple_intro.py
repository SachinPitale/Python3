# Tuple is data structure 
# Tuple can be stored any datatype
# Most important tuples are immutebale, once tuple is created we cann't update
# Data inside the tuple
# Tuple are faster than lists

# we used following method in tuples
# count
# index
# len 
# slicing

print (numbers.count(1))
print (numbers.index(4))
